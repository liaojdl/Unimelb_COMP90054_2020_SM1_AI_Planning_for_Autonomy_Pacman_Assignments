Project 1 and Project 2: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project1.html
Project 3: https://berkeleyai.github.io/cs188-website/project3.html

###Project 1 covers the implementation of search algorithms including Depth First Search (DFS),
Breadth-First Search (BFS), Enforced Hill Climbing (EHC), Iterative Deepening A* and 
Deceptive Path Planning.

###Project 2 models the Pacman using PDDL language.

###Project 3 is about the application of Reinforcement Learning in Pacman.
